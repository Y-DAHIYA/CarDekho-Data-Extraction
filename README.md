# Project: Web Scraping, Data Processing, and Dashboard Deployment

## 📌 Overview
This project involves end-to-end data processing, from web scraping to dashboard deployment. The steps include:
1. **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from a website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processing and structuring the scraped data.
3. **SQL Upload**: Storing cleaned data in a database.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating insights using Python libraries.
5. **Model Preparation**: Building and training a machine learning model.
6. **Streamlit Upload**: Deploying the model and visualizations via Streamlit.
7. **Dashboard Creation**: Developing an interactive dashboard.

## 📂 Tech Stack
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Deployment**: Streamlit
